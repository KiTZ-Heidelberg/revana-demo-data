# Installation

## Requirements

Running and installing **Revana** requires a current installation of **R (version 4.2.1 or greater)**.
No dependencies/R packages need to be installed in advance, as the installation process will provide the required dependencies.

Also, please make sure your system has the software installed that R requires for **package compilation**. View the R documentation of _install.packages"_ for details:

**For Windows users**

> [To successfully install packages that need compilation] on **Windows**, you will need to have installed the **Rtools collection** as described in the ‘R for Windows FAQ’ and you must have the ‘PATH’ environment variable set up as required by Rtools.

For more details see

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html

or

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Windows-packages

**For Linux/MacOS users**

> On **Unix-alikes**, when the package contains C/C++/Fortran code that needs compilation, suitable compilers and related tools need to be installed.
> On macOS you need to have installed the ‘Command-line tools for Xcode’ (see the ‘R Installation and Administration’ manual) and if needed by the package a Fortran compiler, and have them in your path.

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#macOS-packages

or

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Essential-and-useful-other-programs-under-a-Unix_002dalike

:warning: **Attention users with Apple M1 devices** :warning:

Mac users with the new Apple M1 chip must use the Intel 64-bit build of R, as Bioconductor does not currently support the Apple silicon-specific arm64 build of R. Installation of Revana on the arm64 build of R will fail due to incompability with Bioconductor dependencies.

See http://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_15_release/ for details.


As R itself is usually being compiled with these tools upon its installation, the required compiler software will already be available on your system in most cases.

## Installer: "Devtools" R-package

**Revana** can be easily installed from inside the R console with the help of "**Remotes**". **Remotes** is a widely used R package that provides an easy way to install other R packages from sources outside of CRAN. We consider it the **most reliable and convenient way to install Revana**, which is hosted on github.com.

_Additional information: Remotes is a more lightweight isolation of the installation utilities provided by devtools. Therefore, we recommend it for the installation of Revana. Nevertheless, if you have **devtools** installed and are accustomed to its usage, feel free to install Revana with its **install_github** function: devtools::install_github("https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana")_

## How to install Revana

First install **remotes**, if you haven't installed it already.

You can do this by executing the following code inside the R console:

```{R echo = TRUE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("remotes")
```

After that you can proceed with the **installation of Revana**.

Executing the following code inside the R console will install Revana and all its dependencies:

```{R echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana")
```

Revana relies on a large number of dependencies. While this is necessary to provide you with its rich functionality, it does not come without any caveats.

- Depending on the number of previously installed packages, the download and installation process might take some time. You might want to grab a coffee while the installation proceeds.

- While Revana **does not need to be compiled** throughout installation, some of its dependencies do. Depending on your system this compilation can take some time or even fail. Use the following steps to troubleshoot:

  - Make sure you have the required compilers and software installed on your system. See **"Requirements"** above for details.

  - Setting _options(pkgType = "both")_ makes R preferably install binary versions of the packages if available. Also, select to install binary versions of the packages, when prompted. This can greatly increase installation speed under Windows and MacOS systems. Unfortunately, this option is **not available for Linux distributions** and users will be forced to await package compilation.

  - Please do not hesitate to contact us (elias.ulrich@kitz-heidelberg.de), if you are facing any problems throughout the installation of Revana.

# Demo Report

In the following, we will run you through a small demonstration. To view the results of our **entire demonstration cohort** and see some of the **more advanced features** in action, open https://kitz-heidelberg.github.io/revana-demo-report/report.html .

# Running Revana with demo data

To make the usage of Revana as accessible as possible, this guide will run you through its usage step by step. We provide you with a **small sample of genomic data of patients with medulloblastoma** (group 3 and 4) and will use it to **demonstrate the workflow of Revana**.

First download the demo data from github: https://github.com/KiTZ-Heidelberg/revana-demo-data/raw/released/demo_data.zip

Unpack the directory.

Revana uses a **paths.txt** file as input. This file is used to provide the paths to your input data.

To help you understand how the paths.txt file can be created, we have not provided it with the demo data. Instead we will create it manually.

To do this open an R session and execute the following code:

```{R echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# insert the path to the unzipped folder containing the demo data here
# also: please use an absolute path starting with "/" (on Linux and MacOS)
demo_data_path <- "/path/to/demo/data/folder"

# this will create the required paths.txt files for medulloblastoma subgroups (Group 3 and Group 4)
for(GROUP_NAME in c("group_3","group_4")){

  # get the sample ids from the demo data
  sample_ids <- list.dirs(file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME), full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE)

  # create a data frame containing the paths
  paths <- data.frame(
    sample_id = sample_ids,
    marker_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".markers.txt")),
    CNA_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".CNA.txt")),
    somatic_SNV_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".somatic_SNV.txt")),
    expression_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".expression.txt")),
    SV_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".SVs.txt")),
    copy_number_file =file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, sample_ids, paste0(sample_ids, ".copy_number.txt"))
  )

  # use readr (should be available after installing Revana!) to create a text file with the paths
  readr::write_tsv(paths, file.path(demo_data_path,GROUP_NAME,"paths.txt"))
}
```

_Side Note:_

_The function file.path merges its arguments into a path._
_For example: file.path("/path/to/my","custom","directory") will output "/path/to/my/custom/directory"_

**Now it is time to let Revana run its analysis!**

Please note, that in order to keep this demonstration as simple as possible, we omitted some of the features and data integration capabilities in this demonstration. To find out everything about the more sophisticated features of Revana, please view the documentation.

Run the following code:

```{R echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(revana)

# !!! Please adjust the following paths !!!
# you can find the demo references in the subfolder "references" within the unzipped demo data folder

demo_data_path <- "/path/to/demo/data/folder"
demo_references_path <- file.path(demo_data_path, "references")


# you have to specify an output directory to store your result data
# in this case we create a output folder within the demo data folder

results_folder <- file.path(demo_data_path, "output")
dir.create(results_folder)


# Also, within that folder we create a directory for each analysed subgroup,
# just to keep everything tidy.

results_folder_group_3 <- file.path(results_folder, "group_3")
dir.create(results_folder_group_3)

results_folder_group_4 <- file.path(results_folder, "group_4")
dir.create(results_folder_group_4)



# run Revana for Group 3 (you can also loop over the groups like above)
GROUP_NAME <- "group_3"

run(
  # path to the created paths file
  paths_file_path = file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, "paths.txt"),

  # output directory to store results
  output_dir = results_folder_group_3,

  # path to the gene annotation file
  gene_annotation_ref_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "gene_ref.txt"),

  # path to the exon annotation file
  gene_annotation_exons_ref_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "exon_ref.txt"),

  # path to the TAD file
  TAD_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "TADs.txt"),

  #name of the included subgroup or cohort in this case: "group_3"
  subgroup_name = GROUP_NAME
)




# run Revana for Group 4
GROUP_NAME <- "group_4"

run(
  # path to the created paths file
  paths_file_path = file.path(demo_data_path, GROUP_NAME, "paths.txt"),

  # output directory to store results
  output_dir = results_folder_group_4,

  # path to the gene annotation file
  gene_annotation_ref_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "gene_ref.txt"),

  # path to the exon annotation file
  gene_annotation_exons_ref_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "exon_ref.txt"),

  # path to the TAD file
  TAD_file_path = file.path(demo_references_path, "TADs.txt"),

  #name of the included subgroup or cohort in this case: "group_4"
  subgroup_name = GROUP_NAME
)



```

After analysing the demo data for regulatory variants, let's **create the summarizing HTML report**.

As you might have noticed our output directory contains many different files, with all kind of result data. For each subgroup there is also a file results.paths.txt file, that contains the paths to the result files. It will serve as input for our report building function.

As we want to include the result data of medulloblastoma groups 3 and 4, we will first have to merge the files.

```{R echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

group_3_results_file <- file.path(results_folder_group_3,"results.paths.txt")
group_4_results_file <- file.path(results_folder_group_4,"results.paths.txt")

all_groups_results_file <- file.path(results_folder,"all_groups.results.paths.txt")

merge_results_paths_files(
  list_of_results_paths_files = list(
    group_3_results_file,
    group_4_results_file
  ),

  # where the merged file will be stored
  # you can replace this line with any custom path
  output_path_merged_results_file = all_groups_results_file
)



```

To create the report, first create an output folder for it. This folder will be portable as long as you don't change its structure. Then run the report builder:

```{R echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# Path to the created folder - again: you can use any directory you desire
HTML_report_output_dir_path <- file.path(results_folder,"report")

# create the folder, as it doesn't exist yet
dir.create(HTML_report_output_dir_path)

# create the HTML report
create_HTML_report_new(
  # output directory, where the HTML report should be stored
  HTML_report_output_dir_path,
  # results paths file - see above
  output_paths_file_path = all_groups_results_file
)

```

That's it! Now you should be able to view the report by opening the created _report.html_ file with an up to date version of your favorite browser like Google Chrome.
